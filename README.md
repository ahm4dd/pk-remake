## 📖 Usage
- **Interactive Mode**: Type commands at `Pokedex > ` prompt.

- **Tips**: Use `theme no-color` for accessibility; `daily` for challenges.
- **Exiting**: `exit` or Ctrl+C (progress auto-saves).

For command details, see [Commands Manual](COMMANDS.md).

## 🛠️ Development
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Test**: `npm test` (32 tests included)
- **Docs**: `npm run docs` (generates API docs and command manual)
- **Lint**: Add ESLint for code quality.
- **Contribute**: Fork, branch, test, PR. Follow TDD for new features.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
- **App Won't Start?** Ensure Node.js is installed; try `node --version`.
- **REPL Issues?** Use a basic terminal; disable echo with `stty -echo`.
- **Database Errors?** Delete `pokemon.db` to reset (loses data).
- **Performance?** Check internet for API calls; app caches responses.
